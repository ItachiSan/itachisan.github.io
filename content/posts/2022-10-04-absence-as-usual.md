Well, hello again!
It has been **just** over an year since the last post. :wink:

I have a few articles in the cauldron, hopefully they will get out soon.
Especially, I had some time experimenting and fixing some stuff I wanted to get working for quite some time.

If all goes well, you will get:

* The journey of upgrading a Vue SPA from Vue CLI to Vite
* How I repacked the OBS Browser plugin in order to be built on Linux without requiring building the full OBS
* How to actually Secure Boot on ArchLinux with Grub (if I get it working with shim... PreLoader is old but works)

That's all folks for now! :smile:
