Here I am, back to this blog.

It has been, oh boy, more than 6 years since my last article here.

Well, the main reason of my silence is that my view for this blog faded away
slowly.

While initially I was planning to use this to share cool tech tutorials with my
friends, I quickly lost patience doing so.

Additionally, all the life events that happened, which include a change of
country and starting a family, took my attention away from any news writing.

However, I always had an itch for this website to come back, somehow.
And I do believe I have an idea of how to.

Meanwhile, enjoy the code updates in the repository. Bests!
