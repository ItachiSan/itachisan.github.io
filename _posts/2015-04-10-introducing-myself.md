title: Introducing myself
---

Finally, here I am.
I finally made it.
I did what no one ever succeded in.
Yeah.
I setted up a blog.
Yeah.
... Uh.
Lots of people already did with Wordpress, you say?
Doh.

Yeah, I've got *lots of* ***sarcasm***.

### Who the hell are you?

The one who's writing this blog. *Even if you now can't sense it.*
Anyways, I'm an IT student who loves new things. In particular, I **love**
***simple stuff that works fine***.

As this website, ***for example***.

Is built over a *static website generator which handles Markdown files*, the
awesome [Jekyll](http://jeyllrb.com) and the even more awesome
[Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme.

Even this post is written in **Markdown**, which is just *formatted plain text*.

Interested? Take a look [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

### Seriously, who are you?

Fine, even if **I'm asking to myself** (while writing this post, *you should know*).
I'm Giovanni Santini, as for now an *Italian* **Informatics Science**
universitary student; I've lots of Internet stuff (*Facebook*, *Google+*,
*YouTube* **et cetera**) and probably you already know me for some of them
(*if you do*).

Here I'll post some thoughts about my IT/nerding adventures (*yuppie*) or about
my *philosophy* (I love **logics** and similar stuff).
I'll fix in some time the *About* page, so you'll be able to contact me.

And, as an important man said,
**KTHXBYE**

Or was it just [LOLCODE](http://lolcode.org)? Nevermind.
