Yup, **prevent bad words mode** is *ON*. ;(

Anyways, as I didn't post stuff here for a while, I just wanted to report a
really useful source, which I used for setting up *HTTPS* for this blog.
I will also point out the differences between the original tutorial and the
setup for **TK** domains.

## GIMME THE LINK!!!!1!1!
So, the original tutorial is here:
[rck.ms HTTPS setup tutorial](https://rck.ms/jekyll-github-pages-custom-domain-gandi-https-ssl-cloudflare/)
